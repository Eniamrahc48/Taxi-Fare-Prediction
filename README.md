One of the best features of these applications is the display of rates beforehand. The application uses algorithms that display the journey fare based on the destination and time of booking. (Flexi pricing).
 
### Project approach :
* Pre-processing the data
* Creating relevant features
* Applying supervised machine learning techniques to predict the prices.
* Evaluating the model
